# How to work with TOPs

There is no TOPs specific methods at the moment. TouchEngine TOPs are treated as UE Texture2D values.

You can work with TOPs in a similar fashion that you are already working with textures across Unreal.

Some of the compressed formats supported by Unreal are currently not supported by TouchEngine.
